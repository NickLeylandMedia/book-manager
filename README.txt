Welcome to my library app!

It is built with react, tailwindcss and axios!

To get started...

1. Navigate to this project directory on your local machine.

2. Open the terminal and execute the command 'npm i'.

3. Once it is finished installing, execute the command 'npm run start'.

4. The app should open in your web browser! (If it doesn't... open your web browser and navigate to localhost:3000/)

In the app...

1. Enter an open library ID in the search box and click add. (If book is already in library, an error will be thrown!)

2. Verify and modify the information as you would like. (All fields are auto filled with data from the Open Library Books API. The description is a random excerpt from the book.)

3. Click 'save' to save the book to your library, or 'cancel' to quit without saving changes.

4. If you saved, you will now see the book in your library list! Refreshing the page will also show that this is saved to local storage.

5. Click on your book to edit it.

6. Edit any fields as desired, 'save' to save, 'cancel' to quit and discard changes, 'delete' to delete the book!
